    <h4>Steps Needed for Making Stuffed Mushrooms</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.
Overhead shot of measured ingredients gathered to make creamy mushroom soup</li>
<li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li>
<li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>
<li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
<li>Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
<li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
